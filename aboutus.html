          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <h4>When Julius Sudi bought the first acre of land in Muranga in what he envisioned as Sudi Farms today in 1989 , he planted an avocado tree which still stands today as a result of careful tending to by all the members of the Sudi Family. The same nourishing hands still oversee and are involved in the farm to this day.
We pride ourselves on supplying local markets supermarkets, butcheries, hotels, and institutions of knowledge, butcheries and individuals who buy in bulk.
